## Projet datacuisiniers : How to quantify the actors success ? ##

# Abstract : #
Quantifying an actor's success is inherently subjective, because there are numerous ways to assess this problem. Our objective is to develop a model capable of various factors, including an actor's career longevity, accumulated awards, revenue attributed to their involvement in films, and the ratings received by their movies. Considering several potential biases—such as  local cinematographic productions, historical period of activity, available data, gender, and more—we address these issues through geographical, historical, economic, and ethical analyses. Moreover, it's important to note that supplementary datasets, particularly those related to ratings and awards, might be biased too, such as a focus on awards from Western productions exclusively for example.
